# Humans as Attack Vectors — Writeup 

## Room overview

**Goal:** Learn the role of the human element in cyber security. Understand the SOC role in detecting and mitigating attacks. Practice the acquired knowledge in two realistic scenarios

---

## 1) The Human Element — description

**Description:**
Humans are targeted because of the access they can provide to websites, mailboxes, or databases. Threat actors may hunt for specific access and be selective through different attack methods of social engineering to seek specific access.

**Q:** What or who is the weakest link in cyber security?
**A:** `Humans`

**Q:** Who do attackers seek when targeting humans in cyberattack?
**A:** `Access`

---

## 2) Attacks on Humans — description

**Description:**
Attacks on humans rely on manipulation of victims through social engineering, exploiting human psychology rather than technical flaws. Common Social engineering attacks are phishing attacks, malware downloads, and deepfakes (e.g. impersonation).

**Q:**What is the name of an attack tactic that manipulates human psychology?
**A:** `Social Engineering`

**Q:**Which social engineering method is about pretending to be someone else??
**A:** `Impersonation`

## 3) Defending Humans — description

**Description:**
Defending against threats involves two key tasks: Mitigation and Detection. Mitigation aims to prevent or reduce the chance and impact of attacks, for example by training employees or deploying a good anti-phishing solution
* **Anti-phishing solution	SOC routine becomes easier with a tool that blocks phishing emails before the users even notice
* **Antivirus / EDR solution	A reliable antivirus on all corporate hosts is a great measure to prevent humans from running malware
* **"Trust but verify" principle	Instruct your employees how to detect deepfakes and verify suspicious requests from "CEO" or "IT"
* **Security awareness training	Teach your employees how to detect phishing and reinforce training through phishing simulations

**Q:** Which process is aimed at preventing or reducing the chance of an attack?
**A:** `Mitigation`

**Q:** Which mitigation measure is about training employees in cyber security??
**A:** `Security Awareness Training`

## 4) Final challenge — description

**Description:**
The room’s final interactive challenge has you protecting your coworkers by evaluating employee risk based on the scenario's security policy 

---

## Final summary — description

**Description:**
This room provides a brief overview of social engineering and corporate security policies centering on how humans are the most significant point of vulnerability at most organizations.
