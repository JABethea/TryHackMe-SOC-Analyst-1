# Systems as Attack Vectors — Writeup 

## Room overview

**Goal:*Learn what the systems SOC analysts interface with are, how threat groups target them, and what SOC analysts do to keep organizations secure. Learn the role of a system in a modern digital world. Explore a variety of real-world attacks targeting systems.

## 1) Definition of System — description

**Description:**
A brief overview of systems and their conceptual significance in the world of security, and the neceessities of protecting systems and storage. Examples are provided on the security of Microsoft 365 and mailbox platforms. 

**Q:** Can cyber attacks happen without victim intervention (Yea/Nay)?
**A:** `Yea`

**Q:** Can a breach of just a single system lead to disastrous consequences (Yea/Nay)?
**A:** `Yea`

## 2) Attacks on Systems — description

**Description:**
Overview of system attacks, their goal of gaining access to target systems for different motivations (e.g. data exfiltration, ransomware deplyment, or data destruction). Examples with brief overviews on attacks such as Human-Led Attacks, Vulnerabilities, and Supply Cahin attacks are given. 

**Q:**What is the CVE for the critical SharePoint vulnerability dubbed "ToolShell"?
**A:** `Vulnerability`

**Q:**What is the name of the attack when malware comes from a trusted app or library?
**A:** `Supply Chain`

---

## 3) Vulnerabilities — description

**Description:**
Provision of specific vulneraility examples, such as Shellshock Linux vulnerability discovered in 2014 that has existed since 2014. Also briefly touches on zero-day attacks and SOC analyst response to these attacks. Defines CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and provides famous examples such as PrintNightmare and EternalBlue. 

**Q:** Which process is aimed at preventing or reducing the chance of an attack?
**A:** `CVE-2025-53770`

**Q:** How would you respond to a detected vulnerability on your system?
**A:** `Patch`

---

## 4) Misconfigurations — description

**Description:**
Much like CVEs and Vulnerabilities are discussed in the previous section, this gives a brief overview of misconfigurations and TI team responses. Specific examples are given with AWS cloud and IOT devices, such as a smart fridge. Further details and information are given with Misconfiguration response through Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Scans, and Configuration Audits. 
**Q:**Can a system patch or software update fix the misconfigurations (Yea/Nay)?
**A:** `Nay`

**Q:**Which activity involves an authorized cyber attack to detect the misconfigurations?
**A:** `Penetration Testing`

## 5) Final challenge — description

**Description:**
This room provides hands on practices with a follow up from the previous Humans as Attack Vectors section, through analysis of Systems at Risk and deployment or Remediation Plans. 

---

## Final summary — description

**Description:**
This room provides brief overview of systems, their exploitation potential, and the response plans commonly taken by SOC and cybersecurity teams.
